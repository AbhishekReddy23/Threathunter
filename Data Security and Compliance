2. Security Domains
Security domains define the scope and focus of protection strategies for different types of assets. Each domain has unique objectives and methods, but all work together to create a comprehensive security posture.
Security Domain	Focus Area & Scope	Key Objectives & Examples
IT Security	Digital data and IT infrastructure	Prevent unauthorized access, use firewalls, manage user access
Information Security	All forms of information (digital, physical, verbal)	Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data
Cybersecurity	Digital threats in cyberspace (internet, networks, systems)	Prevent cyber attacks, use IDS, secure coding, vulnerability assessments
Operational Security	Processes for handling and protecting sensitive information	Limit access by role, monitor for leaks, enforce policies
Key Differences:
•	IT Security is technology-centric, focusing on digital infrastructure1.
•	Information Security is the broadest, covering all information types2.
•	Cybersecurity is a subset of InfoSec, specializing in digital threats.
•	Operational Security emphasizes human and procedural controls1.
